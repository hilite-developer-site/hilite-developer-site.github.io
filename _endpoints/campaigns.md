## Campaigns

Brands generate campaigns. This is usually done via our [admin console](https://admin.hilite.media) but, if you prefer to build your own, the routes to do so are listed below. Campaigns both send requests to users, and contain all submitted [deliverables](/endpoints/deliverables.html) for that campaign.
