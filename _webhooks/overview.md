### What Is a Webhook?

Webhooks are "user-defined HTTP callbacks". They are triggered by an event that has occurred within HILITE, such as a video upload or campaign created. When that event occurs, HILITE makes an HTTP request to the URI configured for the webhook if defined. The advantage of this approach is that users can configure them to invoke behaviour on another platform of their choosing at the time the event occurs. The action taken may be anything. Common uses are to send notifications of new campaigns or push uploaded videos to social media channels. Webhooks offer a simple and flexible way to customize and extend HILITE's functionality in ways unique to your organizations needs.
